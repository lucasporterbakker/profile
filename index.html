      <h2 id="company-heading">FOUNDER and CEO // Westgroup</h2>
      <p>I founded Westgroup | 西思路 along with six co-founders; which we established as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE) in Hangzhou, China. During my time as the CEO, Westgroup went from being newly licensed to the foremost Canadian education company in Zhejiang Province - having taught thousands of students - and expanded operations into marketing, training, and technology. Westgroup has worked with Chinese governmental organizations, state-owned enterprises, both Canadian and Chinese companies and businesses, universities, and now manages a portfolio of 100+ private clients. We also collaborated on numerous G20 projects with the Chinese government and won the national public bid for Xiaoshan International Airport.</p>
